The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an issue where the specificity of selectors leads to unexpected results. The goal is to style both the `p` and `span` elements within the `.container` div. However, the `span` element's style is overridden by the more specific selector `.container p span`.  To fix this, consider using more appropriate selectors or adjusting the order of your CSS rules.
